15 shaders exploring signed distance functions and procedural effects:

| Piece | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| Still Life 2 | Pear with convex bulge facets and procedural skin texture (speckles, vertical gradient, noise bump, SSS) |
| Bust | Minimal Venus de Milo (4 ellipsoids) with mottled marble faceting |

### Raymarching Notes

These shaders use sphere tracing to render implicit surfaces. Key parameters:

- **Step size** (`t += min(h.x, 0.3) * 0.5`) - smaller = smoother but slower
- **MAX_STEPS** - more iterations reach further, cost performance
- **Spacing** (in `mod()`) - controls density of repeated geometry
- **Fog** (`exp(-0.08 * res.x)`) - distance fade intensity

## Whitney Collection

9 pieces exploring harmonic motion and "differential dynamics":

| Piece | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Lapis | Inspired by James Whitney's 1966 film |

## Glyphs

5 modes exploring ASCII art, letterforms, and symbol morphing:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Waves | Animated ASCII wave pattern with split-screen comparison |
| Image | Convert any image to ASCII (drag/drop or URL) |
| Platonic | Raymarched Platonic solids in ASCII |
| Cube | Rotating cube with per-face characters |
| Glyphs | SDF symbols (circle, cross, triangle, diamond, star) morphing between forms |

### How It Works

Instead of mapping brightness to character density (`. : - = + * # @`), this approach uses **6D shape vectors** that describe WHERE the density is within each character cell:

1. Divide each cell into 6 regions (2x3 staggered grid)
2. Sample brightness at each region
3. Find the character whose shape vector is closest (Euclidean distance in 6D space)
4. Render using a font texture atlas for crisp, readable characters

This allows ASCII characters to follow contours and edges, not just represent overall darkness.

## Tiles

4 tiling and cellular pattern effects:

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Voronoi | Cellular noise pattern |
| HexGrid | Hexagonal tiling |
| Tiles | Geometric tile patterns with rotation |
| Varitiles | Grid of tiles with per-cell random shape, rotation, color, and scale |

## Stipple Renderer

Real-time stippling effect inspired by Robert Hodgin's (flight404) magnetic particle algorithm from ~2009.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Webcam | Live stippling of webcam feed |
| Image | Stipple any image (drag/drop or URL) |

### Hodgin's Original Algorithm

Hodgin's approach used physics simulation:
1. Populate space with magnetic particles that repel each other
2. Each particle checks the underlying image brightness
3. **Dark areas**: particles shrink, magnetic charge weakens, allowing tighter packing
4. **Light areas**: particles grow larger, stronger charge pushes them apart
5. Particles settle organically into a stippled pattern
6. Optional: draw thin lines between nearby particles

### Shader Approximation

Since real-time particle simulation isn't feasible in a fragment shader, this implementation approximates the effect:

1. **Multi-scale grids** - Three overlapping grids at different densities. Finer grids only activate in darker areas, mimicking how smaller particles pack tightly
2. **Luminance-based sizing** - Dot radius scales with local brightness (larger dots = more ink in dark areas)
3. **Pseudo-random jitter** - Hash-based offsets break grid regularity for organic feel
4. **Grey background** - Middle-value canvas allows dots to paint both light and dark
5. **Optional line connections** - Thin lines between nearby dots in dark regions

### Controls

- **Density** - Grid resolution (more/fewer dots)
- **Dot Size** - Overall scale multiplier
- **Contrast** - Boost luminance range of source
- **Lines** - Toggle connecting lines between nearby dots
- **Invert** - White dots on dark background

## Characters

Animated shader creatures using 2D distance fields and procedural animation.

| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frightened | Six pastel blobs with repulsion physics, nervously huddling together |
| Stickfolk | Stick figures from line/circle SDFs — walking, waving, jumping |

### Techniques

**Frightened:**
- **Repulsion physics** - Blobs push away from each other to avoid overlap
- **Procedural animation** - Nervous trembling, orbital movement, individual jitter
- **Per-creature eyes** - Each blob has its own pair of eyes looking the same direction

**Stickfolk:**
- **Line-segment SDFs** - Body, arms, and legs built from line segments with rounded caps
- **Action cycling** - Each figure walks, waves, or jumps based on its phase offset
- **Mouse tracking** - Heads turn toward the cursor

## Landscape

Raymarched terrain scenes.

| Piece | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Lightning | Multi-plane dark landscape illuminated by simplex noise lightning bolts |
| Sand | Procedural sand dunes with wavy ripple texture, slow circular pan (adapted from Shane's "Desert Sand") |

### Techniques

**Lightning:**
- **Multi-plane compositing** - Three depth layers (sky → far hills → near hills) with the lightning bolt rendered between them for a theatrical silhouette effect
- **Simplex noise bolts** - Vertical lightning generated from 3D simplex FBM, producing organic, jagged bolt shapes
- **Flash timing** - Three overlapping strike intervals create irregular, natural-feeling lightning patterns with sharp attack and exponential decay
- **Terrain raymarching** - Two independent noise-based heightfields at different scales and offsets for foreground and background hill layers

**Sand:**
- **Dune generation** - Layered smoothstep noise with triangle-wave ridgelines for rounded dune shapes
- **Sand ripple texture** - Two rotated gradient line layers perturbed by noise and screen-blended for realistic wavy sand patterns
- **Bump-mapped surface** - Ripple pattern follows terrain contours via terrain-gradient perturbation
- **Circular panning camera** - Slow orbit over the dunes with terrain-following height, no flying

### Controls

- **Speed** - Animation rate (storm timing / camera orbit speed)
- **Intensity** - Lightning flash brightness / sun scatter strength
- **Near Hills** - Terrain height scale
- **Camera Height** - Raise or lower the viewpoint

## Displace

Vertex-displaced subdivided plane with image texture mapping — the first section using true 3D geometry rather than fullscreen quads.

| Piece | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Terrain | 128x128 subdivided plane with simplex FBM vertex displacement |

### Techniques

- **Subdivided plane mesh** - 129x129 vertices (16,641) with indexed triangles via `gl.drawElements`, generated in JS
- **Simplex noise displacement** - 3D simplex FBM (4 octaves) pushes vertices along Y based on XZ position + time
- **Finite-difference normals** - Normals computed in the vertex shader by sampling noise at nearby points for accurate directional lighting
- **Minimal matrix math** - Perspective projection and lookAt view matrix implemented without dependencies (~30 lines)
- **Orbiting camera** - Slow automatic orbit around the terrain
- **Image texture mapping** - Upload/drop an image to map it onto the deformed surface; fallback gradient (blue → sand → snow) when no image is loaded

### Controls

- **Displacement** - Height of the noise-based vertex displacement
- **Noise Scale** - Frequency of the noise pattern (higher = more detailed terrain)
- **Speed** - Animation speed of the noise displacement

## Particles

GPU-accelerated particle simulations using ping-pong framebuffer techniques.

| Simulation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Murmuration | Starling flock using Boids algorithm (separation, alignment, cohesion) |
| Ragdoll | Verlet integration physics with distance constraints |
| Lenia | Particle Lenia — continuous artificial life with Gaussian kernel forces |

### How It Works

Both simulations store particle state in textures and update via fragment shaders:

1. **Ping-pong buffers** - Two textures alternate as read/write targets each frame
2. **Position/velocity encoding** - Particle data packed into RGBA channels
3. **GPU parallelism** - Each texel computes one particle independently

**Murmuration (Boids):**
- 4,096 particles (64x64 texture)
- Each particle samples neighbors and applies three steering forces
- Hartman & Benes "change of leadership" — random birds temporarily become leaders who suppress cohesion/alignment and steer independently, pulling nearby birds along and creating organic flock splitting/reforming
- Leadership timer stored in velocity texture alpha channel (no extra textures needed)
- Triangular sprites oriented to velocity direction
- Twilight sky background with atmospheric depth

**Ragdoll (Verlet):**
- 64 stick figures, 16 joints each
- Verlet integration: `newPos = pos + (pos - prevPos) * damping + accel * dt²`
- Data-driven constraint table — skeleton topology defined once as a `vec3` array, iterated with a loop instead of per-particle if/else branching
- 8 constraint-solving passes per frame to maintain bone lengths
- Floor collision and mouse repulsion

**Lenia (Particle Lenia):**
- 200 particles on a 16×16 state texture
- N-body Gaussian kernel forces: short-range repulsion + longer-range growth/attraction
- `peak_f` (Gaussian) computes both value and derivative for force calculation
- Particles self-organize into clusters and patterns
- Additive-blended gaussian spot rendering with energy-driven color

### Controls

- **Murmuration**: Separation, Cohesion, Alignment sliders
- **Ragdoll**: Gravity, Damping sliders
- **Lenia**: Kernel μ/σ, Growth μ/σ, Repulsion, Steps per frame
- Mouse interaction affects Murmuration and Ragdoll

## Reaction Diffusion

Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion simulation visualized on a 3D twisted torus.

### Techniques

- **Gray-Scott simulation** — 256×256 ping-pong textures with two chemicals (A and B). Chemical B catalyzes its own production from A while both diffuse and decay
- **Diagonal blur** — Samples at half-texel offsets with `LINEAR` texture filtering for efficient diffusion (no explicit Laplacian stencil)
- **Parametric torus mesh** — 128×256 grid (33K vertices) with positions computed entirely in the vertex shader from UV coordinates
- **Displacement mapping** — Chemical B concentration drives tube radius (`mix(0.1, 0.6, v)`), creating organic bumps where patterns form
- **Helical twist** — Tube angle includes `UV.y * twist` term, twisting the cross-section pattern around the ring
- **MVP projection** — Perspective camera orbiting the torus, reusing matrix math from the Displace section

### Controls

- **Steps** — Simulation steps per frame (0–20)
- **Twist** — Helical twist of tube pattern (0–5)
- **Feed** — Feed rate f (controls pattern type)
- **Kill** — Kill rate k (controls pattern type)
- **Space** — Reset simulation

### Pattern Types

Different feed/kill combinations produce different patterns:
- Default (f=0.023, k=0.054): spots and mitosis
- Higher feed: stripes and maze-like patterns
- Lower kill: coral/branching growth

### Intermediate Track

The intermediate exercises are based on techniques from advanced Shadertoy shaders like ["Desert Passage II" by Farbs](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3cVBzy). They bridge the gap between basic exercises and professional shader code.

- **ex10-2 Gradient Noise**: Ken Perlin's approach via IQ's implementation (quintic smoothing)
- **ex10-3 FBM**: Fractal Brownian Motion—layered octaves (2× frequency, 0.5× amplitude)

#### Raymarching (Level 11)
3D rendering with distance fields instead of polygons.

- **ex11-1 Basics**: Sphere tracing algorithm, camera setup, diffuse lighting
- **ex11-2 SDF Shapes**: IQ's distance functions (sphere, box, torus, cylinder, plane)
- **ex11-3 Smooth Blend**: `smin()`/`smax()` for organic metaball-style blending

#### Why These Techniques Matter

These nine exercises cover the core toolkit used in professional shader code:

| Desert Passage II Function | Exercise | What You Learn |
|---------------------------|----------|----------------|
| `hash22()` | ex9-2 | Dave Hoskins' reliable hash |
| `gradN2D()` | ex10-2 | Gradient noise for perturbation |

| `sdSphere()`, `sdBox()` | ex11-2 | Signed distance functions |
| `smax()` | ex11-3 | Smooth blending for terrain |

After completing these exercises, you'll be able to read and understand most advanced Shadertoy shaders.
