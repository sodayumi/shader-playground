This is a clean, repeatable sequence you can follow to set up and run the project locally with everything installed in the project folder.

### 0. Setting up Node.js on macOS

If you don't have Node.js installed, use nvm (Node Version Manager):

**Install nvm:**

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

**Configure your shell** by adding these lines to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if using bash):

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

**Reload your shell and install Node:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
nvm install --lts
```

**If nvm installs the wrong versions**, reinstall with:

```bash
nvm install --reinstall-packages-from=node node
nvm current
npm -v
```

NOTE: You probably already downloaded the software.

### 2. Install Node dependencies locally

From inside `shader-playground`:

```sh
npm install
```

- This reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs everything into `./node_modules` in this directory.[1][2]
- Nothing is installed globally; no admin access is needed.[3][4]

(If installation errors mention missing Node/npm, you need **some** Node in PATH—Herd, nvm, or lab setup—but it doesn’t matter which for this project.)


### 3. Run the dev server (Vite)

Still in `shader-playground`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

- This runs the `dev` script from `package.json`, which calls `vite` from `./node_modules/.bin`.[8][9]
- A URL often [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) will be printed; open it in your browser to see the shader playground.[8]

To stop the dev server, hit `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### 4. Run build and preview

Build a production bundle:

```sh
npm run build
```

Preview the built site locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

These scripts call `vite build` and `vite preview` from the local `node_modules` as well.[10][11]

### 6. Run the linter

```sh
npm run lint
```

This runs `eslint src` using the local ESLint and the `eslint.config.js` you created.[9][5]

### 7. Verify everything is local to the project

From inside `shader-playground`:

```sh
npm root
ls node_modules/.bin | grep -E 'vite|eslint'
```

- `npm root` should print a path ending in `shader-playground/node_modules`.[12]
- The `ls` command should show `vite` and `eslint` in `node_modules/.bin`, confirming tools are installed only for this project.

If you like, run through these steps now and paste any command output that doesn’t match what you expect.
